        <title>I don&#39;t remember when I met anybody</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I must&amp;#39;ve met Stef in 2003, though. I&amp;#39;ve known her since I moved to the city. I&amp;#39;d come home from work and she and McCrady would be drinking on my back porch, just waiting for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;columns large-6 small-10 large-offset-3 small-offset-1&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/cent.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Centralia album cover&quot; title=&quot;This was what she gave us to use as the cover of our first EP, Centralia&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s done all our art for all our albums, and played saw on some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh, though, I&amp;#39;ve known since we were kids. Don&amp;#39;t remember the day I met him either, but we&amp;#39;ve worked it out before. I think I was thirteen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The band started when Josh and me, not having any idea how bands happened, made a cd-r of demos with the drum machine built into his multi-effects pedal, and I&amp;#39;d just hand it out to anybody and tell them when practice was, without asking if they played music or anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/sj.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave I met because he hit on Stef by slipping her a note when she was waiting tables at the Green Room. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul, it must&amp;#39;ve been in Lauren&amp;#39;s basement, she found him wandering around some show, 17 and just moved here from Waterloo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/kick.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruh, I think she said the first time we met was when she came to the island to record on Deep River. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alison was a name I&amp;#39;d heard a million times, an old friend of Dave&amp;#39;s, I think from Queen&amp;#39;s. One of those people who when you meet them, you assume you must&amp;#39;ve met them already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zach, shit I do remember when I met Zach. Hunh.&lt;/p&gt;
