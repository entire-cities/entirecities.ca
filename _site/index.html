                <p>I must&#39;ve met Stef in 2003, though. I&#39;ve known her since I moved to the city. I&#39;d come home from work and she and McCrady would be drinking on my back porch, just waiting for me.</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="columns large-6 small-10 large-offset-3 small-offset-1"><img src="/img/cent.jpg" alt="Centralia album cover" title="This was what she gave us to use as the cover of our first EP, Centralia"></div>
</div>

<p>She&#39;s done all our art for all our albums, and played saw on some.</p>

<p>Josh, though, I&#39;ve known since we were kids. Don&#39;t remember the day I met him either, but we&#39;ve worked it out before. I think I was thirteen?</p>

<p>The band started when Josh and me, not having any idea how bands happened, made a cd-r of demos with the drum machine built into his multi-effects pedal, and I&#39;d just hand it out to anybody and tell them when practice was, without asking if they played music or anything.</p>

<p>Dave I met because he hit on Stef by slipping her a note when she was waiting tables at the Green Room. </p>

<p>Paul, it must&#39;ve been in Lauren&#39;s basement, she found him wandering around some show, 17 and just moved here from Waterloo.</p>

<p><img src="/img/kick.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Ruh, I think she said the first time we met was when she came to the island to record on Deep River. </p>

<p>Alison was a name I&#39;d heard a million times, an old friend of Dave&#39;s, I think from Queen&#39;s. One of those people who when you meet them, you assume you must&#39;ve met them already.</p>

<p>Zach, shit I do remember when I met Zach. Hunh.</p>
