### Built with

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Foundation 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/)
* [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

### Todos

* [ ] Add Dave to team
* [ ] Keep it simple until Dave wants to work with SCSS, gulp, etc.
* [ ] Simple way to make images in posts 12 column width?
* [ ] Prototype video-switcher
* [ ] What's the best way to add shows? A BandsInTown feed or something?
* [ ] Does Jekyll always take this long to compile? Seems ridiculous.
