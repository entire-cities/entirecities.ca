        <title>I don&#39;t remember when I met anybody</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I must&amp;#39;ve met Stef in 2003, though. I&amp;#39;ve known her since I moved to the city. Hard times came and she knew it, and I&amp;#39;d come home from work and she and McCrady would be drinking on my back porch, just waiting for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I met her in the summer, which would be just before I met Tristen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh, though, I&amp;#39;ve known since we were kids. Don&amp;#39;t remember the day I met him either, but we&amp;#39;ve worked it out before.&lt;/p&gt;
