I must've met Stef in 2003, though. I've known her since I moved to the city. I'd come home from work and she and McCrady would be drinking on my back porch, just waiting for me.

She's done all our art for all our albums, and played saw on some.

Josh, though, I've known since we were kids. Don't remember the day I met him either, but we've worked it out before. I think I was thirteen?

The band started when Josh and me, not having any idea how bands happened, made a cd-r of demos with the drum machine built into his multi-effects pedal, and I'd just hand it out to anybody and tell them when practice was, without asking if they played music or anything.

Dave I met because he hit on Stef by slipping her a note when she was waiting tables at the Green Room. 

Paul, it must've been in Lauren's basement, she found him wandering around some show, 17 and just moved here from Waterloo.

Ruh, I think she said the first time we met was when she came to the island to record on Deep River. 

Alison was a name I'd heard a million times, an old friend of Dave's, I think from Queen's. One of those people who when you meet them, you assume you must've met them already.

Zach, shit I do remember when I met Zach. Hunh.
