I must've met Stef in 2003, though. I've known her since I moved to the city. Hard times came and she knew it, and I'd come home from work and she and McCrady would be drinking on my back porch, just waiting for me.

I think I met her in the summer, which would be just before I met Tristen. 

Josh, though, I've known since we were kids. Don't remember the day I met him either, but we've worked it out before.
